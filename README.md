# power Cord
power Cord is a lightweight client mod focused on simplicity and performance.  
As of right now, power Cord is in *very* early stages of development, so feel free to join [this server](https://discord.gg/nFRHhDk) for any questions.

# Installation
See the [installation page of the power Cord Wiki](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord/wiki/Installation).

# How can I install power Cord on Stable or PTB?
You can't. We internally discussed about supporting all Discord channels and even ran an experiment about it, but that didn't give great results.
power Cord was not able to run in some scenarios due to the huge internal differences and made the whole client unusable (crash on start).

# Is this against the ToS?
Long story short... __yes__. power Cord is against the Discord Terms of Service â€” but, you should keep reading:  

As of right now, __Discord is not going out of their way to detect client mods or ban client mod users__. On top of that, power Cord does not make any manual HTTP requests unlike certain client mods / plugins, so your client's user agent is the same as a legitimate client. Meaning, Discord doesn't detect a client mod like power Cord. They can go out of their way to start detecting it, but they don't.  

Hypothetically speaking - even if they somehow did detect power Cord, users are very unlikely to be banned on sight. It doesn't make sense for Discord to start banning a substantial part of it's userbase (client mod users) without any kind of warning. Not to mention it is mandatory for power Cord plugins to be fully API-compliant and ethical, implying power Cord users can't be banned for indirect ToS violations (e.g. selfbotting).
